# ImageClassification_Crack_Wall
 
There are several types of common concrete cracks namely hairline cracks which 
usually develop in the concrete foundation as the concrete cures, shrinkage cracks which 
occur while the concrete is curing, settlement cracks which happen when part of 
concrete sinks or when the ground underneath the slab isn’t compacted correctly as 
well as structural cracks which form due to incorrect design. 
Concrete cracks may endanger the safety and durability of a building if not  
identified quickly and left untreated. Hence, your AI engineer performs
image classification to classify concretes with or without cracks. Your 
developed model is impactful and may save thousands of lives.

The criteria of the project are as follows:
1. Link to the dataset:
  https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/5y9wdsg2zt/2
2. Carry out the whole machine-learning workflow for this project (Problem 
Formulation →Data Preparation→Model Development→Model 
Deployment)
3. For criteria, try to achieve training and validation accuracy of more than 90%
4. Make sure your model is not overfitting.
5. You may apply transfer learning.
6. For model deployment, try to use the model to make some predictions with 
your test data.

# Conclusion

It can be observed that the model is performing well, with both the training and validation accuracies consistently increasing over the epochs. However, it seems that there might be slight overfitting as the validation accuracy slightly decreases in the last epoch compared to the previous ones.

Overall, the model achieves high accuracy, and it is successfully classifying cracked and non-cracked concrete images. Further evaluation and tuning may be required to address the potential overfitting and improve generalization performance.
